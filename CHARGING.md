# Battery Charging Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the temporary procedure for charging the Open Robot Battery. **Note:** This is a temporary charging method. A proper charging circuit is currently being developed.

## Prerequisites

- Power supply capable of delivering 16.8V and 0.8A
- Access to the powerbank connector (requires unscrewing the powerbank)

## Charging Procedure

### Step 1: Access the Connector

1. **Unscrew the powerbank** to gain access to the internal connector.

### Step 2: Connect Power Supply

1. Connect your power supply to the battery connector.
2. **Set the power supply to:**
   - **Voltage:** 16.8V
   - **Current:** 0.8A

### Step 3: Charging

1. Once connected and configured, the battery will begin charging.
2. **Charging time:** Approximately 3 hours

### Step 4: Disconnect

1. After the charging cycle is complete, disconnect the power supply.
2. Reassemble the powerbank by screwing it back together.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **This is a temporary charging solution.** A dedicated charging circuit with proper power supply management is currently under development and will replace this manual procedure in the future.

## Safety Reminders

- Always ensure the power supply is set to the correct voltage (16.8V) and current (0.8A) before connecting.
- Do not exceed the specified voltage and current limits.
- Monitor the charging process and disconnect if any abnormalities are observed.
