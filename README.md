## 📖 Introduction

The **Open Robot Battery** (codename **LANDER**) is an open-source hardware module designed to power up robots, IoT devices, drones, and prototypes.  

It works with **Amperry powerbanks**, which are charged inside Amperry stations, and provides makers, startups, and research labs with a flexible, safe, and modular way to bring portable energy into their projects.  

> ⚠️ **Important**: To use LANDER you need an **Amperry-compatible powerbank**, which must be purchased together with an Amperry station. The LANDER module is open-source, but the powerbanks remain proprietary.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Open hardware design for makers, startups, and research labs  
- ✅ Modular connection system (pogo pins, solenoid lock)  
- ✅ Flexible output: USB-C PD, robotics connectors (XT30/XT60), barrel jacks, etc.  
- ✅ Adaptable form factor – attach to robots, kiosks, IoT devices  
- ✅ Safe and tested with Amperry powerbanks

## 🔌 How It Works
[ Amperry Station ] → [ Powerbank ] → [ LANDER Module ] → [ Your Device ]

1. Powerbanks are charged inside the **Amperry station**.  
2. The charged powerbank is docked into the **LANDER module**.  
3. LANDER adapts the energy and delivers it to your device via your preferred connector.
