# Open Robot Battery

**Open Robot Battery** is an open standard for **modular, swappable robot batteries**, designed to make robotics power systems interoperable, easy to integrate, and adaptable to different platforms.  
It combines **hardware specifications**, **integration guidelines**, and **reference tools** to help makers, researchers, and educators build robotics systems with a shared, well-documented power interface.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Vision
Robotics projects often suffer from incompatible power systems.  
The **Open Robot Battery** standard provides:
- **Modular battery designs** that can be easily swapped between robots.
- **Open electrical & mechanical specifications** for broad compatibility.
- **Reference firmware & APIs** for monitoring and control.
- **Integration guides** for charging stations and onboard systems.
